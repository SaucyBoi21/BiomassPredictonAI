# BiomassPredictonAI
This model will be able to predict biomass, leaf dry weight and leaf area given certain parameters. While it will be trained on lettuce data, it can be used for any other type of plant by simply changing some of the parameters.

You can the run the repository with the following commands:

Windows

```
py -3 -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

MacOS/Linux

```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then you can run the notebook in the IDE of your choice.
